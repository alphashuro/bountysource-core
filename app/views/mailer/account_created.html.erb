<p>Welcome to Bountysource, the marketplace for continuous funding of open-source software. We're thrilled to have you on board!</p>

<p>There is a lot you can do on the site, so we want to point you toward a few good places to start:</p>

  <h3>Install the GitHub plugin</h3>
  <p>If you're looking for a way to start promoting bounties within your community, this is it. Our <a href="<%= "#{Api::Application.config.www_url}tools?utm_source=welcome&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=plugin" %>">plugin for GitHub</a> automatically updates your issues with bounty details.</p>
<% end %>

<h3>Grow your project</h3>
<p>When you <a href="<%= "#{Api::Application.config.www_url}teams/new?utm_source=welcome&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=createteam" %>">create a Team</a>, you can streamline all fundraising efforts by having them in one place -- bounties, fundraisers, and project donations are all centered around Teams.</p>
